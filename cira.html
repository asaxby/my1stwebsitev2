          <span
            >CIRA is a new way for climbers to approach injury recovery. The
            online access to physio appointments is quick and efficient. The
            training plans are designed to address climbing specific, common
            injuries so that people can have a speedy recovery.</span

      <h2>The Process - a user persona</h2>
      <p>
        I wrote a user persona for Anita, a keen climber who uses climbing as a
        basis for her social life and mental well-being as well as a major form
        of exercise. When she is injured it has a huge impact on many different
        areas of her life.

      <p>I drew up a wireframe with the key functions of:</p>
