        <h2>I'm Astrid Saxby a UX / UI designer</h2>
        <p>
          I am not your usual applicant for this post as I am a career changer
          and because of this I offer you extra skills that other applicants
          might not have. It was a brave decision to leave the career I love in
          teaching to follow a new adventure, but I haven’t regretted the
          decision. I have just finished a year-long course on UX design with
          Career Foundary in UX design. During the course I developed an app to
          allow climbers to quickly access a specialised physio or to find a
          training plan to recover from injury. As part of my project have
          researched a range of user testing methods and conducted surveys with
          a range of climbers. I analysed the results and then developed user
          personas and a user flow for the app. Using the knowledge from my
          research I designed wireframes and animated prototypes to show the
          working of the app. I conducted more user testing and integrated the
          results into the final design. Feedback from fellow students and CF
          staff praised the clean, clear, professional appearance of the app and
          complimented its usability. So why did I want to leave the career I
          love to go into UX? Well, I am someone who loves a challenge and loves
          to learn new things. One of my favourite activities as a teacher was
          to come up with new resources which would help students understand a
          complex topic, creating visual, appealing and understandable resources
          for secondary students who might have a reading age of around 7 when
          their chronological age was 15 was one of the best parts of the job.
          One of my greatest skills is to be able to look at something complex
          and to develop a logical sequence through it. I have also redesigned a
          booking system for my climbers’ club huts and produced a prototype
          with 2 simple screens in which to input a range of complex
          information, this straight-forward app will automate a process which
          was previously done manually by a volunteer. Before teaching I worked
          as a Development Trainer running groupwork sessions. I ran training
          for up to 48 young people, organising accommodation, staffing,
          activities and training workshops during the week-long courses. I am
          someone who likes to be active, and my interests reflect this, I am an
          keen rock-climber and caver, I love to travel and have visited over 40
          countries in the world, I’m always looking forward to the next
          adventure.
